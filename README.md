# Smart_Console

This is a CLI Console, aimed to provide auto-suggestion functionality for any CLI command with any parameters. 

It provides a simple structure to let user easily define all the relationships between the command keyword and parameter keywords, so that auto-suggestion logic will read the defined structure and smartly suggest the needed commands or parameters in a small popup window.

Use Scintilla for the CLI Console texts and auto-suggestion window, and use JsonCpp to define the config file structures in JSON.
